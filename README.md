Data Requirements
The project is designed to work with text datasets formatted in CSV files. The expected structure is:

Columns:

text: The raw text data to be processed.

label: The target variable for classification.

Additional columns may be included for further analysis or custom feature extraction. Ensure that your dataset is appropriately split into training and testing subsets, or modify the notebook to accommodate your data splits.

Model Training and Evaluation
Training Pipeline
The notebook demonstrates an end-to-end training pipeline that includes:

Data Loading & Cleaning: Import the dataset and apply rigorous text preprocessing.

Feature Extraction: Convert text data into numerical representations using BoW and additional advanced features.

Model Training: Train one or more classifiers using scikit-learn, including options for hyperparameter tuning.

Evaluation: Compute and visualize key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Running the Training Process
Within the notebook, execute each cell sequentially to:

Load and preprocess the data.

Extract features.

Train the chosen machine learning model.

Evaluate the model using comprehensive metrics and visualizations.

Usage Examples
Below is a sample code snippet to illustrate the workflow:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
from preprocessing import preprocess_text  # Custom module for text cleaning
from feature_extraction import extract_features  # Custom module for BoW and advanced features
from model_training import train_model, evaluate_model  # Custom modules for training and evaluation

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/dataset.csv')

# Preprocess the text data
data['clean_text'] = data['text'].apply(preprocess_text)

# Feature extraction
features, labels = extract_features(data['clean_text'], data['label'])

# Train the model
model = train_model(features, labels)

# Evaluate the model
results = evaluate_model(model, features, labels)
print("Model Evaluation Metrics:", results)
This example shows how to seamlessly integrate the preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation steps in a modular fashion.
